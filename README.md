# Interactive-Visualizations-and-Dashboards
The purpose of this activity was to create a webpage with an interactive dashboard that would update the data displayed on its charts using a dropdown event. I had several problems while i was coding, with the most notable one being that at one point, I had managed to make the webpage work initially, but it did not show anything when I tried to use the drop down event. After several days of debugging, I learned the problem was that I had hard coded my index when I should have made it a variable and mapped it to the data. Once I did that, everything worked fine.
